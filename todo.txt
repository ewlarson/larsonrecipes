Cupboard Veggie Curry

Mostly, this is about using whatever veggies you have in the fridge and in the cupboard. Don't worry if you have a can of baby corn, or maybe broccoli and not cauliflower. Curry loves all veggies, toss them in!

Ingredients
8oz mushrooms
1 large carrot
1/2 a cauliflower
1 red onion
10-12 new potatoes
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can full fat coconut milk
1 can veggie stock
2 tablespoons red curry paste
2-3 cloves garlic minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 cup Basmati rice
1 T olive oil
1 or 2 pinches of Saffron (optional)

Garnishes
Torn Basil leaves
Chopped green onion
Chili-lime peanuts (you gotta!)
Chili garlic paste (don't wimp out)

Directions
Make the rice first. 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water. Add a tablespoon of olive oil. Add a pince or two of saffron, if you have it. Stir. Bring to a boil. Cover and keep at a low simmer for 20 minutes. When the timer goes off, just kill the heat and leave it covered. The longer it sits the better it'll be.

Heat some oil in a large pot or dutch oven. Add the mushrooms and saut√© until they begin to release their liquid.

Add minced garlic and ginger, give it a minute to cook. Add your veggies from hardest to softest. So! Add the carrots and give them a minute. Add the cauliflower and give them a minute. Add the onion and give them a minute. Add red curry paste, stir until veggies are well covered. You should be pretty happy with the veggies texture in the pot before adding liquids.

Add the can of tomatoes and their liquid. Add the coconut milk. Add the can of veggie stock. Maybe add more stock if necessary, or a light beer even. Whatever you feel like. Add the potatoes.

Cover and keep a low simmer for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through.

Serve with rice. Garnish.
