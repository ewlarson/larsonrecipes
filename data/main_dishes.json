Pinch 4 edges together to seal. Place pot stickers on a large baking sheet sprinkled with cornstarch. Heat 1 ½ teaspoons canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 12 pot stickers to pan; cook 2 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown. Slowly add ½ cup water to pan; cover and cook 4 minutes. Uncover and cook 3 minutes or until liquid evaporates. Repeat procedure with remaining 1 ½ teaspoons canola oil, 12 pot stickers, and ½ cup water. To prepare sauce, combine ¼ cup water and next 5 ingredients (through sugar) in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Serve sauce with pot stickers. Garnish with chopped green onions, if desired."
